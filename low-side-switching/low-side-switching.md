# Low Side Switching

Note: some of this (especially terminology) has been slightly simplified and not all edge cases were accounted for, for the sake of clarity. I tried to retain accuracy and nuance everywhere it is important to understand the concepts. I figure if you're able to identify the changes, you probably don't need to be reading this anyway

## So what is it?

When you are switching an electronic load in a simple DC circuit, you have two options. You can switch the positive voltage going to the load (hereinafter, the supply), or you can switch the negative (or zero) voltage coming back from the load (hereinafter, the return). We call the former "high-side switching" and the latter "low-side switching".

If you prefer a visual illustration:

This is a high side circuit:

This is a low side circuit:

## But why? This is stupid


## Why should I care?
