# Collection of random stuff I feel might be helpful to others.
Feel free to poke around. I'll try to list stuff with a short description in this file, should there turn out to be more than one thing.

Text contributions/amendments generally welcome

I make no guarantee anything here will be accurate/helpful/whatever. Use this information at your own risk. I am not responsible if you electrocute/ignite/otherwise-injure yourself or anyone else, or for any other mishaps. As always, use common sense. Don't lick the shocky thing.
